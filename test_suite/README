The file runallexamples.m runs all examples described in the paper. This takes at least 4 hours. 

Problems can be run independently by executing the commands mentioned in runallexamples.m independently. 
Note however, that the scripts produce and save data. Hence, they should be executed in the folder where they are located.

In general all examples create four files
pop*.mat : structure containing the polynomial optimization problem, which is considered. 
sdp*.mat : structure containing the SDP generated by BSOS, SBSOS, or SPUT corresponding to relaxation d (and parameter k)
sol*.mat : structure containing the solution of the SDP, solved by the procedure sqlp() of SDPT3
psol*.mat: structure containing information on lower bounds or optimal values of pop, computed from the solution of the sdp. 

Once the files sdp*, sol*, and psol* were created, they are not generated a second time, unless one of them was deleted. If pop was deleted
all other corresponding files are generated again. 

After the examples were run, the files Table_*.m provide an overview over the results similar to the tables presented in the paper.
